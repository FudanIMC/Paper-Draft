	In this paper, we tackle the problem of semantic segmentation in real-world images. Semantic segmentation is the task of assigning each superpixel to one of semantic categories. Although similar problems such as fully supervised and weakly supervised semantic segmentation have been previously studied, we focus on performing semantic segmentation in real-world setting, where only source of annotation are image-level labels encoding which categories are present in the image, and worse, the annotation can be noisy. To address these issues, we present a joint {\textcolor{red}{TBD:approach}}. In experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC2007 and SIFT-flow datasets, our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches and achieves accuracy comparable with fully supervised methods. In addition, we also verify both robustness and effectiveness of our method to noisy annotation condition and show that our method can tackle noisy images with incorrect or incomplete annotations.
