We tackle the problem of weakly supervised semantic segmentation for social images, whose labels are provided by Internet users.
This is an extremely difficult task because the labels are not pixel-level but image-level and usually imprecise or incomplete.
In this paper, we present a joint conditional random field model leveraging various contextual relations to address this issue. 
More specifically, we utilize feature representation generated by convolutional neural network and latent semantic concept model as well as label correlations captured by visual contextual cues and label co-occurrence statistics to handle the noisy annotations.
Experimental results on two real-world image datasets PASCAL VOC2007 and SIFT-flow show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art weakly supervised approaches and even achieves accuracy comparable with fully supervised methods.
