\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have investigated the challenging but realistic problem of weakly supervised segmentation in real-world settings. We present a novel approach incorporating {\textcolor{red}{ label correlation, appearance model and topic model into a unified CRF model}}. We show that our method can put up with noisy images with incorrect or incomplete annotations. To demonstrate both robustness and effectiveness of our method, we perform experiments on two real-world datasets and illustrate improvement over existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation techniques on standard datasets.
In the future we will focus on Internet image collections, which are notably larger and remarkably diverse. We can evaluate the proposed method directly over the social image collection with user-provided tag while we need to manual generate the ground truth segmentations for the evaluation.
