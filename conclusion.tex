\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we have investigated the challenging but realistic problem of weakly supervised segmentation for social images, where the only source of annotation are image-level labels, or even worse, the annotation can be imprecise/incomplete. To tackle this issue, we present a unified conditional random field incorporating various contextual relations, for instance, the associations between semantic concepts and visual appearance, label correlations, spatial neighborhood clues, and label consistency between image-level and pixel-level. We show both robustness and effectiveness of our method which can put up with social images with incorrect or incomplete annotations. Experiments on two real-world datasets illustrate improvement over existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation techniques on standard datasets.
